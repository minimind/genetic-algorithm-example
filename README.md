# Very Simple Genetic Algorithm in Python

I wanted to write the simplest genetic algorithm program I could that was still useful.
This means it had to have abstract genotypes, mutation operators, and trials.
So I had to use either Python or LISP, and Python won.

The example shown creates a population of numbers and evolves a population with lower numbers.
Pretty basic.

I got it down to 17 lines of easy-to-read Python and I'd like to hear very much if anyone
can do it in less without cheating.
